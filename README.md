### Airline Database
In this course assignment (Databases, 4th semester) we were asked to implement a relational database of an airline company. In the database are stored various information needed for it in order to function properly such as: reservations, tickets, boarding passes, airports, flights etc. You can read the whole assignment given to us, in Greek, [here](https://github.com/vagman/database-class/blob/main/assignment/assignment2022.pdf).

Update 3/8/2022: All of the assignment's questions were implemented (except the Cursor one, Question 3.b) and were correct.

### General Info
* We used Visio Professional (there is a free equivalent, [Lucidchart](https://www.lucidchart.com/) in order to implement the Entity-Relation digram. Allthough it wasn't asked by the assignment papper, it would later on help us implement a more correct (BCNF) database. You can find the final diagram [here](https://github.com/vagman/database-class/blob/main/assignment/AairlineDB.vsdx), download it and open it with Visio.
